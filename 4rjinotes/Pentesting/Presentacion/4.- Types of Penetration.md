The different types of penetration testing include:

- Network Services
- Web Application
- Client Side
- Wireless
- Social Engineering
- Physical Penetration Testing

[Each type of penetration test requires specific knowledge, methodologies, and tools](https://purplesec.us/penetration-testing-methodologies/) to perform and **should align with a specific business goal**.

These goals could range from improving awareness of social engineering attacks to employees company-wide, to implementing secure code development to identify flaws in software code in real-time, or meeting regulatory or compliance obligations.

### **Network Service Penetration Testing**

[Network service penetration testing, or infrastructure testing](https://purplesec.us/network-penetration-test/), is one of the most common types of penetration testing performed.

The main purpose is to identify the most exposed vulnerabilities and security weaknesses in the network infrastructure (servers, firewalls, switches, routers, printers, workstations, and more) of an organization before they can be exploited.

#### **Why Should You Perform A Network Service Penetration Test?**

Network penetration tests should be performed to [protect your business from common network-based attacks](https://purplesec.us/protect-business-cyber-attacks/) including:

- [Firewall Misconfiguration And Firewall Bypass](https://purplesec.us/firewall-penetration-testing/)
- [IPS/IDS](https://purplesec.us/intrusion-detection-vs-intrusion-prevention-systems/) Evasion Attacks
- Router Attacks
- DNS Level Attacks:
    - Zone Transfer Attacks
    - Switching Or Routing Based Attacks
- SSH Attacks
- Proxy Server Attacks
- Unnecessary Open Ports Attacks
- Database Attacks
- Man In The Middle (MITM) Attacks
- FTP/SMTP Based Attacks

Given that a network provides mission-critical services to a business, it is recommended that both internal and external network penetration tests be performed at least annually. This will provide your business with adequate coverage to protect against these attack vectors.


### **Web Application Penetration Testing**

[Web application penetration testing](https://purplesec.us/web-application-penetration-testing/) is used to discover vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in web-based applications. It uses different penetration techniques and attacks with aims to break into the web application itself.


The typical scope for a web application penetration test includes web based applications, browsers, and their components such as ActiveX, Plugins, Silverlight, Scriptlets, and Applets.

These types of tests are far more detailed and targeted and therefore are considered to be a more complex test. In order to complete a successful test, the endpoints of every web-based application that interacts with the user on a regular basis must be identified.

This requires a fair amount of effort and time from planning to executing the test, and finally compiling a useful report.

The techniques of web application penetration testing are continuously evolving with time due to the increase in threats coming from web applications day by day. This threat has expanded greatly since the outbreak of COVID-19, resulting a [600% increase in cybercrime](https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/).

#### **Why Should You Perform A Web Application Penetration Test?**

A key reason to perform a web application penetration test is to identify security weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the web based applications and its components like Database, Source Code, and the back-end network.

It also helps by prioritizing the determined weaknesses or vulnerabilities and provides possible solutions to mitigate them.

In software application development it’s considered best practice to continuously improve the codebase. [Deploying a secure and agile code](https://www.checkmarx.com/2017/04/20/six-steps-secure-software-development-agile-era/) is the phrase often used to describe this practice.

Agile code deployment is the preferred method over large batch deployments, as the more variables introduced into the code in a single deployment, the more opportunities there are to create bugs or errors leading to security vulnerabilities.

As a result, technical debt forms, where developers gradually spend more time implementing fixes to problems then they do develop new features or updates.

In contrast, agile methodologies use a sandbox environment (a duplicate copy of the codebase) to test code functionality and usability prior to launching into production. If the deployment is unsuccessful, developers can easily single out the change and roll the code back to previous version history.

The trick is balancing daily code deployment with security in mind.

It’s not uncommon for enterprise software companies to employ pen testers to continuously test their code. Google, as well as other tech giants, [offer a reward for finding and reporting on vulnerabilities within their applications](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/).

### **Client Side Penetration Testing**

Client side penetration testing is used to discover vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in client side applications.

These could be a program or applications such as Putty, email clients, web browsers (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), Macromedia Flash, and others. Programs like Adobe Photoshop and the Microsoft Office Suite are also subject to testing.

#### **Why Should You Perform A Client-Side Penetration Test?**

Client-side tests are performed to identify specific cyber attacks including:

- Cross-Site Scripting Attacks
- Clickjacking Attacks
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Form Hijacking
- HTML Injection
- Open Redirection
- [Malware Infection](https://purplesec.us/common-malware-types/)

### **Wireless Penetration Testing**

[Wireless penetration testing](https://purplesec.us/perform-wireless-penetration-test/) involves identifying and examining the connections between all devices connected to the business’s wifi. These devices include laptops, tablets, smartphones, and any other internet of things (IoT) devices.

Wireless penetration tests are typically performed onsite as the pen tester needs to be in range of the wireless signal to access it. Alternatively, a [NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html) and [WiFi Pineapple](https://shop.hak5.org/) can be deployed onsite to remotely perform the test.

#### **Why Should You Perform A Wireless Penetration Test?**

Wireless communications are an invisibly running service that allows data to flow in and out of the network. Therefore, this wireless network must be secured from any weaknesses like unauthorized access or data leakage.

Before performing a wireless penetration test you should consider the following:

- Have all access points been identified and how many use poor encryption methods?
- Is the data flowing in and out of the network encrypted and if so, how?
- Are there monitoring systems in place to identify unauthorized users?
- Is there any possibility the IT team could have misconfigured or duplicated a wireless network?
- What are the current measures in place to protect the wireless network?
- Are all wireless access points using WPA protocol?

### **Social Engineering Penetration Testing**

[Social engineering penetration testing](https://purplesec.us/social-engineering-penetration-testing/) is where a malicious actor attempts to persuade or trick users into giving them sensitive information, such as a username and password.

Common types of social engineering attacks used by pen testers include:

- [Phishing Attacks](https://purplesec.us/phishing-whaling-differences/)
- [Vishing](https://purplesec.us/vishing-attacks/)
- [Smishing](https://purplesec.us/smishing-attacks/)
- Tailgating
- Imposters (i.e. Fellow Employees, External Vendors, or Contractors)
- Name Dropping
- Pre-texting
- Dumpster Diving
- Eavesdropping
- Gifts

#### **Why Should You Perform Social Engineering Tests?**

According to recent statistics, [98% of all cyber attacks rely on social engineering](https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/). This is because internal users are one of the biggest threats to a networks security and due to how lucrative the scams are.

Social engineering tests and [awareness programs](https://purplesec.us/learn/security-awareness-training/) have proven to be one of the most effective methods of mitigating an attack.

For example, KnowBe4, the popular email phishing platform, simulates an email phishing attack. When the user clicks on the link they’re taken to a page that informs them that it was a [phishing test](https://purplesec.us/phishing-campaign/)

Remediation training is then provided to help educate and inform users on the most current cyber attacks and how to avoid them.

### **Physical Penetration Testing**

[Physical penetration testing](https://purplesec.us/physical-penetration-testing/) simulates a real-world threat whereby a pen tester attempts to compromise physical barriers to access a business’s infrastructure, building, systems, or employees.

#### **Why Should You Perform A Physical Penetration Test?**

Physical barriers are often an afterthought for most businesses, however, if a malicious actor is able to gain physical access to your server room then they could own your network. Imagine the impact that might have on your business, on your customers, as well as business partnerships.

The primary benefit of a physical penetration test is to expose weaknesses and vulnerabilities in physical controls (locks, barriers, cameras, or sensors) so that flaws can be quickly addressed. Through identifying these weaknesses proper mitigations can be put in place to strengthen the physical security posture.
