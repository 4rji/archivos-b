### **Black Box Penetration Testing**

During a [black box penetration test](https://purplesec.us/learn/black-box-penetration-testing/) (also known as [external penetration testing](https://purplesec.us/external-vs-internal-network-penetration-tests/#External)) the pen tester is given little to no information regarding the IT infrastructure of a business.

The main benefit of this method of testing is to [simulate a real-world cyber attack](https://purplesec.us/prevent-cyber-attacks/), whereby the pen tester assumes the role of an uninformed attacker.

A black box penetration test can take up to six weeks to complete making it one of the longest types of penetration tests. Businesses can expect to pay between $10,000 – $25,000 due to the level of effort involved in planning, performing, testing, and completing the report.

This, of course, all depends on the scope of the project.

One of the easiest ways for pen testers to break into a system during a black box test is by deploying a series of exploits known to work, such as [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003/).

This method of testing is also referred to as the “trial and error” approach, however, there is a high degree of technical skill involved in this process.

### **Gray Box Penetration Testing**

During a gray box penetration test, the pen tester has partial knowledge or access to an internal network or web application.

A pen tester may begin with user privileges on a host and be told to [escalate their privileges to a domain admin](https://purplesec.us/privilege-escalation-attacks/). Or, they could be asked to get access to software code and system architecture diagrams.

One main advantage of a gray box penetration test is that the reporting provides a more focused and efficient assessment of your network’s security.

For instance, instead of spending time with the “trial and error” approach, pen testers performing a gray box penetration test are able to review the network diagrams to identify areas of greatest risk.

From there, the proper countermeasures can be recommended to fill the gaps.



### internal **White Box Penetration Testing**

[White box penetration testing](https://purplesec.us/learn/white-box-penetration-testing/) (also called clear box testing, glass box testing, or [internal penetration testing](https://purplesec.us/external-vs-internal-network-penetration-tests/#Internal)) is when the pen tester has full knowledge and access to the source code and environment.

The goal of a white box penetration test is to conduct an in-depth security audit of a business’s systems and to provide the pen tester with as much detail as possible.

As a result, the tests are more thorough because the pen tester has access to areas where a black box test cannot, such as quality of code and application design.

White box tests do have their disadvantages. For instance, given the level of access the pen tester has it can take longer to decide what areas to focus on. In addition, this method of testing often requires sophisticated and expensive tools such as code analyzers and debuggers.

White box tests can take two to three weeks to complete and cost between $4,000 – $20,000.

In the end, it doesn’t matter whether you perform a black box or a white box penetration test so long as the primary goal of the test is being met.
